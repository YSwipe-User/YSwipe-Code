            <p> <strong style="font-family:'Montserrat'; font-size:x-large ;">Culture</strong></p>
            <br>

            <p> A leading indicator of humans being separate from other life forms. It’s funny how culture has changed
                in the last decade, and we certainly have a long way to go. Which is why the leaps and bounds we aim to
                set, and the culture we’re here to curate will be viewed by many as crazy, anti-business, and
                out-landish. Like most things, in the beginning there are few adopters. If you’re reading this, we ask
                one favor…please keep an open mind.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>Much like our <a href="/Y-Team.html" style="text-decoration: none; color:white"><strong><em>Team
                            Letter</em></strong></a>
                , Founder-Culture-Fit is a major piece of
                how we’re curating our
                internal and
                external environment. How are we viewed from the outside, and how do we feel on the inside? What are our
                actions towards each other, the industry, and our customers? Are we pushing society forward? </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                First, we are big on humans and our nature, the good and the bad. As humans, we’re great at giving
                advice but not taking it. We love ‘the new thing’ but dislike change. We are scared of the future,
                cruise through the present, and acknowledge the past but don’t learn from it. We are at the very least,
                beautiful-problematic-creatures that have changed the world but not without vices. Our point here is, we
                are incredibly complex and simple beings at the same time. Which means, building culture and curating
                the powers that make us human needs to be at the forefront of who we are. Simultaneously, we need to be
                conscious of our mistakes and problem areas if we are to grow as individuals, groups, and a
                civilization. At YSwipe, we believe in bringing this culture and joining it with strong ideas.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Internal culture is the central nervous system to making everything here work. How do we do this? Well,
                we do it simply. We hate to complicate things like culture when business brings plenty of its own
                complications. Therefore our actions and feelings towards culture are as follows:
            </p>
            <br>
            <ul style="padding-left: 4%;">
                <li> ❖ Our organization is flat and decentralized. While we have leaders, individuals are trusted to
                    make big decisions. Everyone here is equal, with no C-suite or titles.</li>
                <li> ❖ We trust our team in all the work they do.</li>
                <li> ❖ We do not have strict work hours. We trust you to get your work done. Prefer a 4-day work week?
                    No problem. Your output will need to reflect that. However, our output expectations are incredibly
                    high. This means 4-day work weeks may be possible, but working on weekends may be required as well.
                    These are trade-offs for an equal environment. Our schedules are not linear.</li>
                <li> ❖ We optimize for a small headcount as we grow. We want a small team, which means everyone must be
                    willing to wear many hats. No teammate is too good for any job.</li>
                <li> ❖ Those who contribute value and help us grow in any shape or form will be awarded with bonuses
                    that are not scheduled and can be given out at any point in time. This keeps energy and excitement
                    high for everyone. Let’s build something amazing.</li>
                <li> ❖ As we grow, salaries grow for our team. Additionally, those who vest their time will be rewarded
                    for tenure with ownership and dividends.</li>
                <li> ❖ Finally, and most importantly, only individuals who believe they can truly change the world and
                    contribute value at scale will be asked to join the team.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>
                We are not a company ‘family’, we are the Chicago Bulls in the 90s…we are here for the entire cake.
                Extremely competitive, determined, and relentless. Those that are in our way we will dismantle. This is
                not philanthropy. We cannot change the world with soft mindsets or fragility. We are optimizing for a
                dangerous team to push growth and survival in order to conquer. If a team member is not aligned with
                these values, contributing to our growth, or negatively affecting our culture that member will have to
                move on. This culture needs to be protected at all costs. We never want to let team members go, ever.
                Which means we will need to be very strict and particular with whom we draft to the YSwipe team, which
                takes time. No worries, we aren’t planning on going anywhere.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                We are in our early days, which means our power as it accrues to recruitment and attracting top talent
                is not as strong as it will be in the future. To that point, our team will grow and change until we find
                an equilibrium of top talent that fits survival and growth.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Our external culture as it relates to molding our industry and affecting others, is tied to our business
                model. It is very much based on maximum value distributed, optionality, innovation, adoption, and
                pushing society forward by tapping into human nature. We have a very clear vision of how our products,
                services, and team can provide value at scale to usher in a new age of industry.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In short, we are here to bring the start line to more humans across the globe by pushing disruptive
                technology forward that enables companies and professionals to seamlessly build connections, careers,
                and communications. We do this first with a strong internal <a href="/YS-Culture.html"
