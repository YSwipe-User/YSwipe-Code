            <h6> <strong>Preface:</strong></h6>
            <p>it is important to remember all YSwipe letters are a representation of my personal philosophies, business
                beliefs, and my actions towards value creation. I am only human, and will make mistakes. Assuredly these
                mistakes will be made on the road to providing value to others, while in the pursuit of building a great
                business. YSwipe aspires to be the strongest and most valuable professional connection platform on
                earth. Please note; I am not a strong writer. You will find mistakes alongside poor language use. These
                letters are not meant to flow like a professional writer, instead to convey YSwipe, its philosophy, and
                how weâ€™re building our ecosystem.</p>
            <br>
            <h6> <strong>Our Source of life:</strong></h6>
            <br>
            <p>
                Our customers, you are our holy grail, our answers to success, our most valuable asset, and our source
                of life. You will now and forever be at the center of our existence. Since the inception of YSwipe, our
                purpose is to provide every ounce of value that is required and desired by the public and its
                businesses. To create a professional connection platform that gives users the best experience and
                enhances their life, YSwipe must have a strong feedback loop from customers, and forever have its ear to
                the ground listening to the people of the world. When we receive good feedback on a feature or a piece
                of value, we will always double down. For failures, we ensure to iterate or pivot as quickly and
                fearlessly as needed. It is our job as a company to capitalize on long term value, deliver on our
                propositions, and ensure we continue to keep customers at the forefront of our mission. If you are
                reading this and you are a customer, thank you in advance, we hope to serve you for a lifetime.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                YSwipe provides value to two different groups of customers; individuals and companies. When it comes to
                individuals, we believe in order to make the maximum number of customers happy, we have to give away as
                much value as possible for the lowest price. Initially, public subscriptions will be free, as a way for
                customers to provide feedback on any and all things related to YSwipe. As we grow, the subscription
                models will have more flexibility for our customers on what they can afford as an individual and will
                always include a free model. Depending on what kind of value individuals are looking to derive from
                YSwipe, user customization is at the forefront of our product delivery. We recognize there are two
                different styles of revenue models in business, those that work hard to raise their prices over time,
                and those that work hard to lower their prices over time. We are the ladder.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Similarly, when working with companies our goal is to provide maximum value through customization and
                cost savings, while solving real problems they face. When YSwipe reaches a larger scale, it will fall
                under a new category design, which is explained in our Product Letter. Most enterprises and individuals
                may be laggards in our early stages, however, our current focus is early adopters and innovators. These
                are individuals and enterprises who truly seek out our solutions because it solves a real problem for
                them. If that is you, you have our attention. We understand that implemented correctly, YSwipe can save
                thousands-to-millions for enterprises depending on their size of course. More importantly, YSwipe saves
                users time, hiring managers time, operational time, investment time, and search time.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                At our core, it is important to remember that YSwipe is a people first platform that provides as much
                value to enterprises as it does to the public. YSwipe is about professional connections, and putting
                humans and their personalities at the forefront of their professional profiles so that we may match
                these personalities to the right teams. Because YSwipe is a Private Network, we can connect humans that
                truly need to be connected seamlessly. We know, and believe that human nature will not change and has
                not changed. Based on this knowledge, YSwipe will reach success if it provides value based on basic
                human nature. This â€˜valueâ€™ is human connection. Our job is to be the leader in this space, which
                requires the most basic level of psychology and intuition. On that note, we will push forward in
                bringing the best product and platform to the forefront of society, in hopes of satisfying problems and
                creating value at scale. While we are a private network, and users have their own customizations with
                regards to privacy, we optimize for decentralization within the platform, and push for distribution of
                value and equality. This is important to us, and we believe companies and individuals that utilize the
                YSwipe platform will gain tremendous value from this foundation.
            </p>

            <p>
                YSwipe, has been thoughtfully, carefully, and passionately curating its strategy for high-growth. How
                YSwipe performs and distributes value at scale is something that has been at the core of our strategy
                since the inception of the idea. Acting on these strategies, obsessing over customers, adapting to new
                technology, creating new forms of value, and surviving through downturns and competition, is at the core
                of our daily operations and how we will become the incumbent that remains a startup of survival. Value
                for value will always exist.
