                    Community</em></h3>
            <br>


            <br>
            <br>

            <h4> <strong>Philosophy.</strong></h4>
            <p> First, if you are
                reading this, you are of great value to us, it means the world. So
                thank you in advance. We hope this letter resonates with you, and is a little reflection of who you
                are. It certainly is a piece of who we are.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We wrote this to address some of our philosophies as well to share quotations we reference daily.
                Things that keep us going, which we forget to refer back to from time to time. As humans we tend to
                get caught up in our daily lives and forget important grounding principles.</p>
            <p>We are social creatures that are tribal in nature, we love connecting, building relationships, and
                being valued by others. YSwipe is here to accentuate this, contribute to it, and ultimately provide
                the tools necessary to universally grow our tribes.</p>
            <br>

            <p>All people, teams, and companies are made up of a multitude of characteristics. We, as a team,
                believe in giving the average human a chance to touch their hands down at the start line and tap
                into their potential. History tends to reward those who give, rather than take. We do not condone
                running the race for people, or distributing free value, but we certainly believe in giving. Plenty
                of icons from the past understood this. Great contributors like Jobs, Carnegie, Walton, Musk, Bezos,
                and Singleton, are regarded as the value creators of society. YSwipe, is embarking on this path of
                value disruption, knowing its decades of passion, pain, and relentlessness. Bear with us.</p>
            <br>

            <h4>The Start line</h4>
            <p>Many have spoken about bringing the ‘start line’ to more of the world. The concept of building,
                giving, and supporting a system in which all have a chance ‘at-bat’. What individuals choose to do
                after that is up to them. Planting seeds for stronger competition, equality, and well-being in all
                industry, culture, and society…easier said than done. Regardless, we’re working on it. Please note,
                we believe in a meritocracy, which means we can bring you to the start line, but you still must
                race. Winning is earned not given.</p>
            <br>

            <h4>Incumbents</h4>
            <p>Many incumbents have stopped innovating. As nature usually has it. This disappoints us, and is
                against our nature, but is also an opportunity. We understand when large companies are at a certain
                scale, innovation usually takes a turn for the worst. There are very few companies that are 100+
                years old innovating at scale today. This will likely remain the same, as it is correlated with
                technology and human nature. We understand this, which is why we’ve structured innovation at YSwipe
                far into our future. No company lasts forever. However, with the right leadership in place, and the
                right balance of philosophy, we will provide maximum value and innovate far into the future, no
                matter the field.</p>
            <br>

            <p>One strong lesson we use at YSwipe, which we steal from Seth Godin is; some people believe society
                and culture is to enable business, when in fact the purpose of business is to enable culture and
                society. The people who abuse this have too much influence and are simply wrong. The purpose of
                businesses is not to enable profit for shareholders, but instead to enable humanity, solve problems,
                and provide a path forward. We do not forget this.</p>
            <br>

            <p>We would like to be very clear on our view of the global market and those that wish to compete with
                us. There is no doubt that we will provide more value. The market is ours as far as we’re concerned.
                Simply because we have the best value to give to customers, the community, and humans in general and
                we will stop at nothing to provide. We are not in favor of monopolies, unless of course they give
                maximum value to the public and to companies simultaneously, which contradicts itself over time. Our
                mode of survival is very ruthless, and will be durable in the worst of conditions. As relentless as
                we are, it will always be for the betterment of our customers and our relationships. If you haven’t
                noticed, we are entering the arena of businesses not philanthropy, which allows us to positively
                focus on customers. Not competition, not Venture, not Government, not Private equity, not board
                members. Customers. That is it.</p>
            <br>

            <p>When talking about building platforms and marketplaces, it is important to create scalable value for
                its users and creators. At YSwipe, giving this value back to the community and users means giving
                many things to those who are positively active on the platform. What does this look like? Well, we
                have roadmaps and execution plans for building out financial incentives and individual platforms
                that each user can stand on. Similar to social networks, active users and value creators can make a
                living here. At YSwipe, creators that build-out qualitative content can make a living. We provide a
                place for these users to; network, connect, educate, share, engage, build resources, invest, hire,
                and grow companies. Optionality and providing a platform that solves a multitude of problems is at
                the core of YSwipe. We believe video formats are in their infancy when it comes to platforms,
                interfaces, and value creation, especially in the professional space. Another key category in its
                infancy with regards to technology is decentralization of data, customization of privacy, profit
                sharing with circular value. YSwipe will provide all of these things in due time. We are a company
                that operates for profit while giving maximum value to all its users, in many different shapes and
                forms. Most will not agree with our philosophy, and laggards will certainly turn their heads at our
                purpose. We are not worried, nor do we care or base our growth on these groups. Value for value is
                something that will always exist. Many large firms have self-destructive tendencies built into their
                aging DNA, whether they are aware of it or not. YSwipe is here to learn from others' mistakes and
                capitalize on them. To this, our corporate consensus at YSwipe, is here to build a platform that is
                a new category design both internally and externally, solving major industry problems for
                individuals and companies.</p>
            <br>

            <p>While we serve our customers as they are our source of life, when it comes to investors and
                supporters, we act very human and are driven by our emotions. Most say, you should not be emotional
                in business, its dealings, and its failures. We disagree. Until business is solely done by robots,
                we infer that it's conducted by the most emotional living things on earth. As a race of people we
                are more emotional than rational, which is apparent. To be concise, we are always emotional. Those
                that turn us away, bet against us, doubt us, or criticize us, will not be forgotten, it's simply
                emotion, have no worries. YSwipe is only human, being defensive for our survival regardless of our
                mistakes is essential. We rarely forgive those that have contributed to our demise. Conversely,
                those that bet on us, see to our success, and value us, will be rewarded like no other. As YSwipe
                grows, we will be able to give away more value to all supporters that stood by us. And we will.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Alright, let’s get to the fun part. Quotes that mean the world to us and are referred to frequently.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h4><em>We Stand On The Shoulders Of Giants</em></h4>
            <p>Below is a list of quotes from the greats that encompass our philosophy at YSwipe, and are pieces we
                keep close to our chest.</p>

                <li>Marc Andressen quoting Aesthetics and Steve Jobs “Aesthetics are not just appearances, aesthetics go
                    all the way back to a deep underlying meaning of life, in physics they say when a theory might be
